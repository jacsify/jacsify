I fall on my knees, and give thanks to the awesomeness that is this collective of like-minded people coming together to share their resources!

I'll just stay here on the floor, bad knees...

So, Hi, I'm @jacsify, and I have never signed up on GitHub, but I have used some of the resources — so very rude of me, and I apologise. 
I'm actually quite an introvert, however, my keyboard & brain have a separate personality when left to their own devices.

More about me:

Small Business Owner — as in 1 employee... ME!

Graphic Designer

WordPress “Developer”, I use the term loosely, as I try to get as much pre-packaged themes and plugins as possible — it's a time saving thing (that's what I tell myself). Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing though...

Social Media Enthusiast

Apple Obsessed

Avid Vampire Fanatic

Seriesaholic

Marvel Rulez Mmkay!

Wine Scholar

Passionate F1 Follower

On a personal note, I have 3 incredible not-so-little-children, and the most amazing husband (who, during Lockdown has been chief breakfast and lunch maker — else we'd starve). 
Living on the profoundly beautiful Dolphin Coast inspires me and my work, often series like Star Trek or F.R.I.E.N.D.S, or music ranging from Classical to Bring Me The Horizon, are my soundtrack.

You can reach me here... @jacsify, or email: jacquie@applepidesigns.co.za

That's it!

I promise to follow the rules, as the saying goes in South Africa, "rools is rools" (gotta roll those 'r's) and I will surely contribute where I can!

Have a great day y'all!

P.S. Someone help me off the floor, I have a numb bum...
